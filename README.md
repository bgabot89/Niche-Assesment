# Niche Web Developer Exercise

## Introduction

The design you will be implementing for this exercise is a theoretical Q & A feature for students. It contains voting and community response features. 

This exercise has been designed as a way to show off your HTML and CSS skills, with some Javascript sprinkled in as well. We'll be assessing your code for semantics, naming, and structure, as well as achieving the primary goal of making the design come to life. Be prepared to speak to your decisions, and you are also free to provide comments if that helps explain your thinking.

The intent is that this exercise take a couple hours. Please do not spend much more than that.

## Instructions

### Goal
- Your main goal is get the design looking as close as possible to the provided design. You can reference the designs in `/screenshots` or the original Figma files (for more detail) linked here:
    - https://www.figma.com/file/KgGE0sjAYekRDKp2Xzs5NK/Web-Developer-Exercise---BG?node-id=0%3A1

- Assets have been provided in the `assets` folder, but you may also export them from Figma if that's easier for you
- Colors have been listed in start.html, in a comment in the head
- We've already included the primary typeface, Source Sans Pro, in start.html
- Use your best judgement for design details or behaviors that have not been specified

### Requirements
- For this exercise, you should implement:
    - Responsive layout that changes with screen size (desktop and mobile designs have been provided)
        - Desktop mockups contain most of the interaction/behavior details, but they should be the same for mobile
    - Interactive states (eg, hover) for relevant elements
- Choose ONE interactive behavior to implement:
    - Upvote/downvote buttons increase/decrease the vote count by 1
        - You can't upvote/downvote more than one for each question
    - "Hearting" a response fills the icon and increases the count by 1
        - You can't upvote an individual response more than once
    - Adding a new response
        - You can't add an empty response
        - "Cancel" returns to the default state
        - "Submit" adds the response to the bottom of the responses

### Guidance
- You may use any tools you see fit to create your code. Frameworks, compilers, or packages that can make your code easier to read and maintain are all encouraged.
- We've provided some HTML and content as a starting point. A few classes have been added for clarity, but you'll need to make your own decisions about what else to add, remove, or change. You should adjust the code as appropriate for the use case, considering semantics, accessibility, best practices, and any other reason you see fit. 

### Submitting
- You'll submit your solution to your Niche recruiter to be passed along to the hiring team. You may upload your code to a public Github repository, send a link to a shared cloud folder (eg Google Drive), or simply zip your code up and attach it to an email, whatever is easiest for you. Please include instructions if your code requires a build step, package installation, etc.
